This code creates an interactive web application that helps users explore and visualize the close approaches of asteroids and comets to various celestial bodies, such as Earth, Mars, or the Moon. Imagine being able to see when and how close these space objects come to planets or moons over a certain period. This application makes that possible by fetching data from NASA's databases and presenting it in an easy-to-understand format with beautiful visualizations.

### **How the Application Works**

1. **Setting Up the Environment:**
   - The application uses **Streamlit**, a tool that allows developers to build interactive web apps quickly using Python.
   - It also leverages other Python libraries like **requests** for handling web requests, **pandas** for data manipulation, and **plotly.express** for creating interactive charts.

2. **Choosing a Celestial Body:**
   - Users can select a celestial body (like Earth, Mars, or the Moon) from a dropdown menu in the sidebar. This selection determines which planet or moon's close approaches will be analyzed.

3. **Selecting the Date Range:**
   - Users can specify a start date and either choose a number of days from that start date or select a specific end date. This range defines the period over which the application will look for close approaches.

4. **Defining Distance Parameters:**
   - Users can set the maximum distance for considering close approaches. The distance can be measured in Astronomical Units (AU) or Lunar Distances (LD). An Astronomical Unit is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, while a Lunar Distance is the distance between the Earth and the Moon.

5. **Filtering by Object Type:**
   - The application allows users to filter results based on the type of object: Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), Comets, or Both. This helps in narrowing down the data to specific kinds of celestial objects.

6. **Fetching and Visualizing Data:**
   - Upon clicking the "Fetch and Visualize Data" button, the application sends a request to NASA's **Close Approach Data (CAD) API** to retrieve information about the close approaches based on the user's parameters.
   - The fetched data includes details like the designation of the object, the date of close approach, distance, relative velocity, and infinity velocity.
   - This data is then displayed in a table for easy viewing. Users also have the option to download this data as a CSV file for offline analysis.

7. **Interactive Visualization:**
   - The application uses **Plotly**, a powerful visualization library, to create an interactive scatter plot. This plot shows the dates of close approaches on the horizontal axis and the distances on the vertical axis.
   - Users can hover over data points to see more details about each close approach.
   - There's also an option to add a trendline to the chart, which helps in identifying patterns or trends in the data. However, this feature requires an additional library called **statsmodels**.

8. **User-Friendly Features:**
   - The application provides real-time feedback using messages and spinners to inform users about the status of their requests, such as when data is being fetched or if no data is found.
   - The design is clean and organized, with a sidebar for inputs and a main area for displaying results and visualizations.

### **Key Components of the Code**

1. **Import Statements:**
   - The application starts by importing necessary libraries:
     - `streamlit` for building the web app interface.
     - `requests` for making HTTP requests to APIs.
     - `pandas` for handling and manipulating data.
     - `plotly.express` for creating interactive plots.
     - `datetime` and `timedelta` for handling dates.
     - `sys` and `io` for system and input/output operations.

2. **Mapping Celestial Bodies:**
   - A dictionary called `AgnirvaBODY_CODES` maps the display names of celestial bodies (like "Mercury" or "Venus") to their corresponding codes used by the NASA API.

3. **Fetching Close Approach Data:**
   - The function `Agnirvafetch_close_approaches` takes parameters like the celestial body code, date range, maximum distance, limit on results, and object type.
   - It constructs a URL to query NASA's CAD API with these parameters.
   - The function handles different object types (NEO, Comet) and manages potential errors by displaying appropriate messages to the user.

4. **Parsing the Data:**
   - The function `Agnirvaparse_data` processes the raw data fetched from the API.
   - It converts date strings to datetime objects and ensures numerical values like distance and velocity are correctly formatted.
   - If no data is found, it warns the user.

5. **Visualizing the Data:**
   - The function `Agnirvavisualize_close_approaches` creates an interactive scatter plot using Plotly.
   - It plots the date of close approaches against their distances, allowing users to hover over points to see more details.
   - An optional trendline can be added to the plot if the user chooses and if the necessary library is installed.

6. **Building the Streamlit App Interface:**
   - The `Agnirvamain` function sets up the entire Streamlit application.
   - **Page Configuration and Title:**
     - Sets the page title and layout.
     - Displays a welcoming message explaining the purpose of the app.
   - **Sidebar Inputs:**
     - Users can select the celestial body, date range, distance parameters, object type, and the number of results to fetch.
     - There's a button to initiate data fetching and visualization.
   - **Data Handling:**
     - Upon clicking the fetch button, the app retrieves data from the API, parses it, and stores it in the session state for persistent access.
     - It handles cases where no data is found or if there's an error during fetching.
   - **Displaying Data and Visualization:**
     - If data is available, it displays a table with the close approach details.
     - Provides a download button for users to save the data.
     - Shows an interactive plot of the data, with an option to add a trendline.
   - **Footer Information:**
     - Credits the data source and the creator of the application.

7. **Running the App:**
   - The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the `Agnirvamain` function runs when the script is executed, launching the Streamlit app.

### **User Experience Flow**

1. **Starting the Application:**
   - When users open the application, they see a welcoming title and a brief description of what the app does.

2. **Configuring Parameters:**
   - In the sidebar, users select the celestial body theyâ€™re interested in, set the date range for close approaches, choose the distance unit and maximum distance, filter by object type, and decide how many results they want to see.

3. **Fetching Data:**
   - After setting their preferences, users click the "Fetch and Visualize Data" button.
   - The app displays a spinner to indicate that it's working on retrieving the data.

4. **Viewing Results:**
   - Once the data is fetched, a success message shows how many close approaches were found.
   - A table displays detailed information about each close approach, such as the designation of the object, the date, distance, and velocities.
   - Users can download this data for their records.

5. **Exploring Visualizations:**
   - An interactive scatter plot visualizes the close approaches over time and their distances.
   - Users can add a trendline to the plot to see overall patterns, provided they have the necessary library installed.
   - The plot is responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on various devices.

6. **Handling Errors and No Data:**
   - If there are issues fetching data, such as network problems or invalid parameters, the app displays clear error messages.
   - If no close approaches are found based on the user's criteria, a warning informs the user to adjust their search parameters.

### **Technical Highlights**
