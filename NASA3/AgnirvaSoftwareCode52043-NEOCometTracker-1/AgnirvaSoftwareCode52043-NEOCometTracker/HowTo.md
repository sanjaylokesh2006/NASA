### **10. Obtain a NASA API Key (Optional but Recommended)**

While the provided code uses NASA's API without an explicit API key, obtaining your own key can help avoid potential rate limits and ensure smoother operation.

1. **Visit NASA's API Portal:**
   - Go to the [NASA API Signup Page](https://api.nasa.gov/).

2. **Request an API Key:**
   - Fill out the required information, such as your name and email address.
   - Submit the form to receive your unique API key via email.

3. **Update the Code with Your API Key (If Needed):**
   - If the API requires an API key in the future, you can include it in the API request parameters within the code.
   - **Example:** Add a parameter like `'api_key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'` to the `Agnirvaparams` dictionary in the `Agnirvafetch_close_approaches` function.

4. **Note:** Currently, the code uses the default settings, and an API key may not be necessary. However, having your own key is beneficial for extended use.
