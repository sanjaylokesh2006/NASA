### **1. Ensure You Have a Computer with Internet Access**
   - **Requirements**:
     - A desktop or laptop computer.
     - An active internet connection.
     - Administrative access to install software if necessary.

### **2. Install Python on Your Computer**
   Python is a programming language required to run this application.
   
   - **For Windows**:
     1. Open your web browser and go to the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
     2. Click on the latest Python version (e.g., Python 3.11.x).
     3. Download the "Windows installer (64-bit)".
     4. Run the downloaded installer.
     5. **Important**: During installation, check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.
     6. Click "Install Now" and follow the on-screen instructions.

   - **For Mac**:
     1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).
     2. Click on the latest Python version (e.g., Python 3.11.x).
     3. Download the "macOS installer".
     4. Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

   - **For Linux**:
     Python often comes pre-installed on Linux distributions. To check, open the Terminal and type:
     ```
     python3 --version
     ```
     If Python is not installed, refer to your distribution‚Äôs package manager to install it. For example, on Ubuntu:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
     ```

### **3. Verify Python Installation**
   - Open the **Command Prompt** on Windows or **Terminal** on Mac/Linux.
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```
     python --version
     ```
     or
     ```
     python3 --version
     ```
   - You should see a response like `Python 3.11.x`. If not, revisit step 2 to ensure Python is correctly installed.

### **4. Install a Code Editor (Optional but Recommended)**
   A code editor helps in viewing and editing code files.
   
   - **Recommended Editor**: [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
     1. Go to the [VS Code Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
     2. Download the installer for your operating system.
     3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install.

   - **Alternative Editors**:
     - **Notepad++** for Windows: [Download Here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
     - **Sublime Text**: [Download Here](https://www.sublimetext.com/download)

### **5. Open Your Web Browser**
   You will need a web browser like **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox**, **Microsoft Edge**, or **Safari** to access the application once it's running.

### **6. Install Required Python Packages**
   The application relies on several Python libraries. These need to be installed using `pip`, Python‚Äôs package installer.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac/Linux).
     2. Type the following commands one by one, pressing Enter after each:
        ```
        pip install streamlit
        pip install requests
        pip install pandas
        pip install plotly
        ```
     3. Wait for each installation to complete. You should see messages indicating successful installations.

### **7. Obtain a NASA API Key (Optional)**
   The application uses NASA‚Äôs DONKI API to fetch space weather data. While the code uses a default `DEMO_KEY`, it has rate limits. For extended usage, obtaining a personal API key is recommended.

   - **How to Get a NASA API Key**:
     1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [NASA API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov/).
     2. Click on **"Sign Up"** or **"Get Started"**.
     3. Fill in the required information to create an account.
     4. After signing up, you will receive a unique **API Key** via email or directly on the website.
     5. **Note**: Keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.

   - **Using the API Key**:
     - When running the application, you can enter your API key in the designated input field to replace the `DEMO_KEY` and avoid rate limits.

### **8. Prepare the Application Code**
   You need to save the provided Python code into a file on your computer.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Open your **Code Editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
     2. Create a new file:
        - In VS Code: Click on **"File"** > **"New File"**.
     3. Copy the entire Python code provided (starting with `import streamlit as st` and ending with the last line of code).
     4. Paste the copied code into the new file in your editor.
     5. Save the file:
        - Click on **"File"** > **"Save As"**.
        - Name the file `space_weather_app.py` (ensure it ends with `.py`).
        - Choose a location that's easy to find, like the **Desktop** or a dedicated **Projects** folder.

### **9. Open Command Prompt or Terminal in the Code Directory**
   To run the application, you need to navigate to the folder where you saved the `space_weather_app.py` file.

   - **Steps**:
     1. **Locate the Folder**:
        - Navigate to the folder where you saved `space_weather_app.py` (e.g., Desktop).
     2. **Open Command Prompt/Terminal**:
        - **Windows**:
          - Click on the **Start** menu.
          - Type `cmd` and press Enter to open Command Prompt.
          - In Command Prompt, type:
            ```
            cd Desktop
            ```
            (Replace `Desktop` with your folder name if different.)
        - **Mac/Linux**:
          - Open **Terminal**.
          - Type:
            ```
            cd ~/Desktop
            ```
            (Replace `Desktop` with your folder name if different.)

### **10. Run the Streamlit Application**
   Now, you'll execute the Python script to launch the application.

   - **Steps**:
     1. In the Command Prompt or Terminal, ensure you are in the directory containing `space_weather_app.py`.
     2. Type the following command and press Enter:
        ```
        streamlit run space_weather_app.py
        ```
     3. The first time you run this, Streamlit may perform some setup tasks. Wait for it to complete.
